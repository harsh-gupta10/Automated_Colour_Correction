# Automated Colour Correction

Automated Colour Correction is an AI-powered tool designed to streamline the workflow of professional photographers, particularly those in the wedding industry. By uploading raw photos, photographers can let our algorithms predict and apply the best color corrections, drastically reducing manual editing time. The tool also allows for manual adjustments and batch processing of photos, ensuring both efficiency and high-quality results. It can Do task of 7-8 hours in 2-3 Minutes

## Project Description

Professional photographers often spend countless hours manually editing photos to achieve the perfect color balance. This process is not only time-consuming but also prone to inconsistencies. The need for an automated solution that can deliver consistent, high-quality color corrections is paramount. Automated Colour Correction addresses this issue by leveraging advanced AI models to automate the color correction process, thereby saving photographers valuable time and effort.
